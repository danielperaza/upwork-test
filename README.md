# Upwork Senior Developer Technical Assessment

## Installation instructions

You are going to need Node JS and npm installed on your system in order to deploy the code to your local.

1. Clone the repository
2. cd into the repository folder ``cd upwork-test``
3. Execute ``npm install``
4. Run ``gulp serve``

This will open a browser window pointing to the ``src/index.html`` file of the code. There you will find further 
instructions on how to run the solution for each of the problems.
